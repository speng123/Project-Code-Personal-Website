<h2> <strong>SuperHero Code of Conduct</strong></h2>
<p>In the words of Spiderman's Uncle Ben, "With great power comes great responsibility". The SuperHero Code of Conduct will guide you in your decisions as you explore and utilize your new superpowers.</p> 
<ol>
    <li>Protect the innocent and defend the weak</li>
    <li>Be brave and courageous.</li>
    <li>Always respond to a call for help when you have capacity.</li>
    <li>Always use your superpower to bring about good.</li>
    <li>Do not use your superpower on others without their consent.</li>
    <li>Choose the fights worth fighting, but never stop fighting for good.</li>
    <li>Empower others to find the superhero and potential within themselves.</li>
    <li>Use your superpowers to help and benefit others, not yourself.</li>
    <li>Do not alter the past or influence the future (Applicable to Time-Related Superpowers)</li>
    <li>Respect and obey the laws of the land (or time). Do not take advantage of your powers to commit crimes. </li>
    <li>Be sure to clean up any messes you made.</li>

    <h2> How It Works</h2>
    <img src="images/information/bottles_bolt.png">
    <p> PowerUp is designed for the modern-day superhero who wants to experience how it feels to have a superpower. The PowerUp supplement comes in a variety of delicious flavors (ambrosia, nectar, mead, honey) and is sourced with real, all-natural
and unique ingredients. Consume your PowerUp 48 hours before you want to use the super power and you will be able to feel the immediate effects within an hour. The entire bottle must be consumed, as once PowerUp is opened it will lose its potency.  </p>
    <p> The effect of the superpower will begin to slowly dissipate 1-2 hours before the 48 hours are up. It is highly recommended you stay on top of the schedule and wrap up your superhero tasks before the effect wears off.</p>
    <p> Please note that you should not take more than one PowerUp at a time as you should only have and use one superpower at a time. Please allow at least 48 hours in between consuming PowerUps.</p>

<h2><strong>Keys to Being a Great Superhero</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li> Although you may be excited about your new superpower, it is recommended that you get acclimated to them first before using it. Designate a safe space to practice using them.</li>
    <li> Saving the world and going on adventures will be more fun (and safer) with a buddy. Find yourself a sidekick who is also passionate about saving the world. Or form a league with other superheroes.</li>
    <li> Even superheroes need to fuel up and rest. Make sure you take time out for breaks and meals. </li>
    <li> Come up with a whole identity around your superpower, including a superhero alias, catchphrases, a backstory, and even a secret identity!</li>
    <li> Expand your comfort zone by trying out new experiences and confronting your fears.</li>
    <li> Pass it forward - inspire and mentor future superheroes.</li>
    
</ul>
